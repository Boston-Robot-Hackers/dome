# Dome

## What is Dome

* its a differential drive robot
* used for learning and experimentation
* not meant as a product
* Called Dome because originally i had planned on putting a dome on top

## Linorobot2

* heavily based on the linorobot2 package by
* Based on the Linorobot2 fork supporting ESP32 f that package by 
* Their documentation is excellent and reliable

## Hardware

* WaveShare Board for Robots
* Rasberry Pi 4B

## CAD

* Key design idea is holes on a 2.5 mm grid
* And 3d Printed "adapters" to mount components on it

## BOM

* two clear plastic plates
* Two motors
* Battery
* Rasberry Pi 4

## Software

* Within this package there is relatively little new python
* Most of it has been setting parameters and creating new launch files
* Much of the code is indepedent and in it's own github repos

## Questions

* The motors are probably too big
* I think the batteries are running out too fast
* Need bigger battery?
* When driving on cement it rattles a lot. Why is that?
* Need softer tires
* Need "suspension"

## Next Gen: Hex

* Idea is to make the next version a hex shape
* Not sure about how many plates
* Because it will allow us to have flat 
* Would be nice if there was a "mast" to hold a camera
* Hext shapes allows 3d-printed panels to create a body
* Mission is more or less the same, this is purely the next gen of Dome
